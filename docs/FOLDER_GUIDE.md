# Folder Guide: docs

## Purpose

This directory contains all project documentation that is not specific to a folder's immediate contents. This includes high-level design documents, user guides, and mockups.

## In-Scope

- Architectural diagrams and design documents.
- User-facing documentation and tutorials.
- UI mockups and design assets.

## Out-of-Scope

- Code-level documentation (this belongs in docstrings within the source code).
- Folder-specific content lists (these belong in the `FOLDER_GUIDE.md` within each respective folder).
- LLM-specific primers and guides (these belong in the `for_llm/` directory).

## Subfolders

- **`ui/`**: Contains mockups and assets related to the user interface, particularly the review UI.

## Files

There are no files in this directory.
