# Project Requirements: auto-commit Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the `auto-commit` agent. The purpose of this agent is to provide autonomous version control by monitoring specified directories and intelligently committing changes with high-quality, LLM-generated messages.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. File System Monitoring
- **REQ-F-01**: The system **shall** monitor a configurable list of local directories for file changes (creation, deletion, modification).
- **REQ-F-02**: File change events **shall** be added to a thread-safe queue for asynchronous processing.

### 2.2. Git Repository Management
- **REQ-F-03**: For any given file change, the system **shall** identify the correct parent Git repository.
- **REQ-F-04**: If a monitored folder is not already a Git repository, the system **shall** automatically initialize a new repository (`git init`) within it.

### 2.3. Commit Generation
- **REQ-F-05**: The system **shall** analyze the file changes (`diff`) to gather context for a commit.
- **REQ-F-06**: The system **shall** interface with an LLM, providing the `diff` and style guide, to generate a structured commit message compliant with the Conventional Commits specification.
- **REQ-F-07**: The system **shall** intelligently manage a `.gitignore` file, adding rules for common temporary or build-related files rather than committing them.

### 2.4. Execution
- **REQ-F-08**: The system **shall** stage the relevant changes using `git add`.
- **REQ-F-09**: The system **shall** execute the commit using the LLM-generated message.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **REQ-NF-01**: **Performance**: The file monitoring process must be lightweight and have minimal impact on system performance.
- **REQ-NF-02**: **Reliability**: The system must be resilient to LLM API failures, falling back to a default commit message and logging the error if necessary.
- **REQ-NF-03**: **Security**: The system must not expose any sensitive information, such as API keys, in its logs or commit history.

## 4. Assumptions and Constraints

*As of the creation of this document, the following assumptions are being made:*

- **A-01**: **Configuration**: The list of folders to be monitored will be specified in a local `config.json` file.
- **A-02**: **LLM Choice**: The primary LLM for this service will be the locally running `sequentialthought` instance accessible via its Docker container.
- **A-03**: **Conflict Handling**: The system will assume it has primary control over the repositories. It will not perform `git pull` or `git push` operations and will only manage the local commit history. It will halt operations on a given repository if the working directory is not clean for reasons other than its own changes.
- **A-04**: **Change Size**: The system will process all detected changes without requiring human intervention, regardless of size.
